## Why Restlight?

In microservices, it is generally expected that service is a lightweight application, and the Spring-Web framework we often use is really a good framework that allows us to develop a variety of applications easily, but it is too bloated for applications in microservices, which just need a rest supports and do not need the session, ModelAndview, JSP and so on... Restlight aims to serve as a web framework that helps users to build a high performance and lightweight microservice.
